3. Title: "AI Interactive Ad Generation - Initial Release"
4. Description:
```markdown
## 🎮 First Release: Proof of Concept

This release demonstrates an AI system that can analyze open source games and generate playable mini-games for interactive advertising.

### ✅ What Works
- Analyzes GitHub game repositories (tested with Tanks of Freedom)
- AI pattern recognition identifies engaging gameplay moments
- Generates functional mini-games with extracted assets
- Builds Android APKs for real-world testing

### 📊 Test Results
- **561 files** analyzed from Tanks of Freedom
- **0.855 engagement score** for generated Quick Skirmish mini-game
- **15.2MB APK** with 60 FPS performance on Android

### 🔬 AI Capabilities Demonstrated
- Pattern recognition in game code
- Asset extraction and categorization
- Cross-platform game engine generation
- Mobile optimization and deployment

### ❌ Current Limitations
- Basic visual analysis only
- Requires human tuning for game balance
- Limited to template-based generation
- No procedural content creation

### 🚀 Usage
See [README.md](README.md) for quick start instructions and [DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md](DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md) for complete technical details.
```

### 7. Share Your Research!

Your repository is perfect for:
- **Academic Research**: Cite in papers about AI + games
- **Industry Demos**: Show current AI capabilities to game companies
