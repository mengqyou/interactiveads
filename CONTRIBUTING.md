- Update CLAUDE.md for development guidance

### 6. Pull Request Process
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation
3. Add clear commit messages
4. Reference related issues
5. Request review from maintainers

## üìä Code Quality Guidelines

### Python Standards
```python
# Good: Clear function with type hints and docstring
def analyze_game_repository(repo_path: Path) -> GameAnalysisReport:
    """
    Analyze a game repository for patterns and assets.
    
    Args:
        repo_path: Path to the game repository
        
    Returns:
        Comprehensive analysis report
        
    Raises:
        RepositoryError: If repository is invalid
    """
    pass

# Good: Descriptive variable names
engagement_score = calculate_engagement_metrics(gameplay_patterns)

# Bad: Unclear abbreviations
eng_scr = calc_eng(gp_pat)
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Good: Specific exception handling
try:
    analysis = analyze_repository(repo_path)
except RepositoryNotFoundError:
    logger.error(f"Repository not found: {repo_path}")
    return None
except PermissionError:
    logger.error(f"Permission denied: {repo_path}")
    return None

# Bad: Catching all exceptions
try:
    analysis = analyze_repository(repo_path)
except:
    return None
```

### Performance Considerations
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Use generators for large datasets
- Cache expensive computations
- Optimize mobile performance

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```python
def test_engagement_scoring():
    """Test engagement scoring algorithm."""
    patterns = {'combat': 0.9, 'strategy': 0.8}
    score = calculate_engagement_score(patterns)
    assert 0.0 <= score <= 1.0
    assert score > 0.5  # Should be engaging
```

### Integration Tests
```python
def test_full_pipeline():
    """Test complete analysis pipeline."""
    repo_path = Path("test_data/sample_game")
    analysis = analyze_game_repository(repo_path)
    moments = find_engaging_moments(analysis)
    assert len(moments) > 0
    assert moments[0].engagement_score > 0.5
```
